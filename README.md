# ResQLearn
CIS Hackathon Project by Team Codeherlics


## App Concept - Quality Education

In the CIS Hackathon, we tackled the issue of the lack of emergency knowledge taught in our traditional education system. We designed a gamification of traditional emergency skills education ResQ Learn for children to learn vital rescue techniques in fun and innovative ways. The overall app consists of the following features: Emergency guides, Preparedness checklists, and Interactive simulators. We used SwiftUI and integrated Spline for the games.
